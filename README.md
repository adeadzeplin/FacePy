# FacePy
WebCam App that only shows a person's face and draw's my body to indicate where my body it.

Covid Sucks, and being stuck in a studio with a roomate means little privacy.
This makes things tough because I tend to interact with people online with my webcam on. Which means my roomate has even less privacy.

So I wrote this to track my face and body parts. Crop everything that isn't my face. And draw a stick figure of my body.

Doing this gives me the benefit of doing webcam calls with friends. And simultaneously NOT encroach on my roomate's privacy.
